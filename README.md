# BIT 3434 CVE Data Mining
BIT 3434 Project on data mining

This is the code and data used for my project on finding how many CVEs are actually exploitable today.

This script is not the most efficient but it does the job in a few hours.

Please check out my blog post for more details about this project: https://s1n1st3r.gitbook.io/theb10g/data-mining-cves-and-exploits
